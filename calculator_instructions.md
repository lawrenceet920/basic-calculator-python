## Python: Topic

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **basic-calculator-starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder


### Writing Your Code

- Watch the [Basic Calculator video](https://www.eduvision.tv/l?RLmgRDg) a couple times so you see how the project works
- **With your team**, discuss what code you think you need to write to recreate the basic calculator shown in the video
  - What Python ingredients, so to speak, would you need to create such a calculator?
  - Think about the topics we've covered so far this year in class
- Once you've written your code, run your script and compare it to what you see in the Basic Calculator video
  - Does your project look and act like the calculator in the video?
  - Revise your code if necessary
- Remember to check your work for spelling, punctuation and capitalization errors, too!
